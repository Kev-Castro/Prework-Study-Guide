          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The "box-shadow" CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame</li>
          <li>The "border" CSS proprety adds a border around an element</li>
          <li>The "margin" CSS property adds a margin top and bottom and "auto" left and right</li>
          <li>"p" is used to align location of text, also to change size.</li>
          <li>"ul" is used to declare font size of text under header and padding to either left or right</li>
          <li>"img"is used to assign property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>The "display" property is assigned with the "blocK" value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>"text align" is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>***There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet***</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use "inline CSS"</li>
          <li>"Internal CSS style sheet" contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>When using an "external CSS style sheet", we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head"</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
          <li> the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</li>
          <li>We can use the "console.log" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>The word "console" refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <li>"".log()"", is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The "".log()"" method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>"var" or "variable" is a core feature which stores data types as values.</li>
          <li>"Control flow" is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the "if" statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. </li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, "arrays are zero-indexed and sequential". This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>“If” statements interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named "length".</li>
          <li>The array length is important because the "for" loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
          <li>A "function" is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A "function" is different from a for loop or conditional statement because "functions" do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run * Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it*</li>
          <li>Function declaration uses the function keyword and name to define a function.</li>
          <li>Code block is where the code goes and the functions it will perform.</li>
          <li>Calling the function: write the function name followed by: ();</li>
          <li>When we call a function the instructions that we provided in the function definition are executed.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Integrated development environment, or IDE: Is a type of software used by developers that combines many of the features needed by developers to do their work in a single interface, known as a graphical user interface, or GUI.</li>
          <li>GUI: Is a way for users to interact with the computer visually.</li>
          <li>MVP: Minimum Viable Product</li>
          <li>Repository (“Repo”): Every project on github is called a repository.</li>
          <li>Branch: Workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
          <li>When creating a new Branch name it to best describe the work. (Example: "contents-3-26") and make the description very detailed but short.</li>
          <li>Markdown (".md"): The way content files are formatted in Github. It is also a way to write for the web using plain text; easily converts to HTML.</li>
          <li>Commit Changes: Is saving a new version of a file you”re working on. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you are making a commit. Commits are when you add change to your Branch.</li>
          <li>Pull Request (“PR”): Asking for changes on a Branch to merge into another Branch. A “PR” is a way to discuss and review your work with others. </li>
          <li>When requesting a PR, be as detailed as possible so your team can know what they're about to be looking at before fully looking into your changes.</li>
          <li>Issue - ways to report new tasks or content fixes. Issues also track progress on Project Board</li>
          <li>User Story - an explanation of a software feature from the user's perspective.</li>
          <li>Acceptance Criteria - allows us to set the requirements that have to be met for us to complete our user story. Sometimes referred to as the definition of “done”.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>You can press Control+Shift+I to open chrome dev tools and inspect.</li>
          <li>Ctrl+F2 Select all copies of occurrences of current word in vscode </li>
