          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The "box-shadow" CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame</li>
          <li>The "border" CSS proprety adds a border around an element</li>
          <li>The "margin" CSS property adds a margin top and bottom and "auto" left and right</li>
          <li>"p" is used to align location of text, also to change size.</li>
          <li>"ul" is used to declare font size of text under header and padding to either left or right</li>

          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use "inline CSS"</li>
          <li>"Internal CSS style sheet" contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code</li>
          <li>When using an "external CSS style sheet", we link the file using a "link" element placed in the HTML's "head"</li>
